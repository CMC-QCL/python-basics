[QCL Workshop] Programming Basics with Python Part 1 (Level 1)

Summary
Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data scientists, web developers, and machine learning practitioners. Its simple syntax makes it an easy-to-write (and an easy-to-learn) language. In this workshop, you will learn the basics of the Python programming language by creating, step by step, a function that will potentially make grocery shopping easier.

This is a workshop designed for beginners, so no prior knowledge of Python or any programming language is needed.
