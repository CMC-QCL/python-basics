## Practical Programming with Python

### Summary
Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data scientists, web developers, and machine learning practitioners.

In this workshop, you will learn the basics of the Python programming language by creating, step by step, a function that will potentially make grocery shopping easier.

This is a workshop designed for beginners, so no prior knowledge of Python or any programming language is needed.

### Prerequisites
