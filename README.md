Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data scientists, web developers, and machine learning practitioners. Its simple syntax makes it an easy-to-write (and an easy-to-learn) language. In this workshop, you will learn the basics of the Python programming language by creating, step by step, a function that will potentially make grocery shopping easier.

This is a workshop designed for beginners, so no prior knowledge of Python or any programming language is needed.

### Learning Objectives

* Create and use functions
* Create lists and dictionaries and access its elements
* Read error messages
* Use for loops
* Use conditional statements (if, elif and else)
